MOST WANTED

Learning Objective

Utilize more advanced JavaScript features like higher-order array methods, callback functions, objects, and recursion to create a more complex JavaScript application that manipulates the given data set to create a person search experience.

User Stories

Total Project Points: /75

(5 points): As a developer, I want to make at least 15 consistent commits with good, descriptive messages.

(5 points): As a developer, I want to run validation on any user input, ensuring that a user is re-prompted when they provide invalid input.

(10 points): As a user, I want to be able to search for someone based on a single criterion

¬∑ You should be able to find and return a list of people who match the search

(15 points): As a user, I want to be able to search for someone based on multiple traits (up to a maximum of five criteria at once).

¬∑ i.e., if you search for Gender: male and Eye Color: blue, you should get back a list of people who match the search. In this case, it will be only people who are male with blue eyes.

(10 points): As a user, I want to be able to look up someone‚Äôs information after I find them with the program (display values for the various traits of the found person).

(15 points): As a user, after locating a person, I want to see only that person‚Äôs descendants (display the names of the descendants).

(15 points): As a user, after locating a person, I want to see only that person‚Äôs immediate family members, displaying the names of the family members and their relation to the found person.

¬∑ i.e., parents, spouse, siblings

Bonus

(5 points): As a user, after locating a person, I want to see only that person‚Äôs descendants (display the names of the descendants), using recursion.

MOST WANTED Framework

Introduction

You have been contracted to build a person-searching application prototype for a top-secret government project. You have been given access to an array of objects representing individuals. The prototype should just use window.prompt and window.alert for the User Interface (UI). Although this isn‚Äôt typical in production, you may use only three files for this project: an HTML file, a JavaScript file for the application, and a JavaScript file containing the data for the application.

üí° Do NOT change any code inside of the data.js file ‚Äì all of your code will be written inside of the app.js file!

Tasks

1. Create and set up GitHub repository with the starter code provided (see Setup Steps below).

2. Using the paired programming methodology (if part of a team), begin tackling features for the application based on the provided user stories.

Setup Steps

1. Select a person on your team to create the GitHub repository for the project. Call it MostWanted_JavaScript

a. Add other team members as collaborators.

2. Make sure your team members check their email associated with their GitHub accounts for the invitation.

3. The creator of the repository should download the zipped version of the starter code for the project (link above). Also clone down the project repository you just created into a project directory on your machine and move the unzipped starter files index.html, app.js, and data.js over to that folder.

4. Push those files up to your repository ( git push ) and have all collaborators pull the updated code (or clone if they haven‚Äôt already). Make sure everyone can open their code as normal.

5. Begin by stepping through the code using the debugger and trying to search for a single person, then displaying information about that person. This will expose a bug! Fixing this bug will be a big step towards understanding the code base.

6. Once you‚Äôve fixed that bug, begin working on the Search by Traits features.
